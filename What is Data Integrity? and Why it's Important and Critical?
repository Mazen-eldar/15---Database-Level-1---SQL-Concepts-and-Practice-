Data Integrity:
• Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data 
over its entire life cycle, from creation to deletion. In other words, it 
refers to the assurance that data is complete, accurate, and trustworthy.

• There are several factors that can impact data integrity, including human 
error, hardware or software failure, security breaches, and data transfer 
errors.

• To maintain data integrity, it is important to establish appropriate 
policies and procedures, and to implement appropriate technologies, such as 
encryption, backups, and access controls.
=====================================================================================
There are different types of data integrity that organizations need to consider:
1. Entity integrity: This ensures that each row or record in a table is unique and 
can be uniquely identified. This is typically achieved through the use of 
primary keys.

2. Referential integrity: This ensures that relationships between tables are 
maintained and that there are no orphaned records. This is typically achieved 
through the use of foreign keys.

3. Domain integrity: This ensures that data is within acceptable ranges or values. 
For example, a date field should only contain valid dates, and a numeric field 
should only contain valid numbers.

4. Business integrity: This ensures that data meets business rules and 
requirements. For example, a bank might have rules around minimum and maximum 
account balances, or a hospital might have rules around patient data 
confidentiality.
=======================================================================================
• Maintaining data integrity is critical for organizations that rely on 
accurate and trustworthy data to make informed decisions. Without data 
integrity, organizations risk making decisions based on incomplete, 
inaccurate, or unreliable data, which can lead to poor outcomes, financial 
losses, and damage to reputation.
