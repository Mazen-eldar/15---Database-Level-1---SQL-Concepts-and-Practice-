2^nd---->Normal Form (2NF)
 Second Normal Form (2NF) is a further level of database 
 normalization that builds on the First Normal Form (1NF) 
 rules.

 It requires that each non-key column in a table be 
 functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just a 
 part of it.


 To satisfy the requirements of 2NF:
 1. A table must first be in 1NF, and then have:
 2. No partial dependencies: Each non-key column in the table 
    must be fully dependent on the entire primary key.
