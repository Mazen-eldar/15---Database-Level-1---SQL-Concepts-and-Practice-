What is Normalization?
 • Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce 
redundancy and improve data consistency. 
• In other words, it is the process of breaking down a larger database 
into smaller, more manageable pieces, while ensuring that the data is 
logically organized and free from redundant information.
 • Normalization is achieved by applying a set of rules, called Normal 
Forms, to the database tables. The higher the normal form, the more 
strictly the rules are applied, and the more normalized the database 
is.
 • The goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies, such as 
duplicate or inconsistent data, which can lead to errors and 
inconsistencies in the database. 
• A normalized database is easier to maintain, update and modify, and can 
be queried more efficiently.
