these tables.

                                                Primary Key vs Foreign Key
                                                ___________________________
Primary Key:
• A primary key is a column or set of columns in a relational database table 
that uniquely identifies each row or record in the table. 

• It is a unique identifier for each record and serves as a reference point 
for other tables that have a relationship with the table in question. 

• Each table in a relational database must have a primary key, and it should 
be a non-null value that is unique and stable over time.

• Primary Key should not be changed.

Foreign Key:
• A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in a table 
that refers to the primary key of another table. 

• It establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing data to be 
shared and linked between them. 

• The foreign key ensures that referential integrity is maintained by 
ensuring that any value in the foreign key column must exist in the primary 
key column of the related table.

Summary:
• In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies a record in a table, while a 
foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing 
the primary key of another table.
