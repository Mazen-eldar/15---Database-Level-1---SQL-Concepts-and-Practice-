================================
Redundancy:
• Redundancy refers to the presence of duplicated data within the database. 
Redundancy can occur in different ways, such as storing the same 
information multiple times, or storing information that can be derived from 
other data in the database.

• While redundancy can sometimes be useful, it can also cause problems. For 
example, redundant data takes up additional storage space and can make it 
more difficult to maintain consistency within the database. If one copy of 
the data is updated, the other copies may become outdated, leading to 
inconsistencies and errors.

• To avoid redundancy in databases, normalization techniques can be used to 
organize the data in a way that minimizes duplication. 
======================================================================================
Normalization:
• Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database in a way that reduces redundancy and improves data integrity. 
  There are several levels of normalization, also known as normal forms, each with its own set of rules.

• To avoid redundancy in databases, normalization techniques can be used to organize the data in a way that minimizes duplication.

• This involves breaking down the data into smaller, more atomic pieces and linking them together through relationships,
  which can reduce the amount of redundant data and make it easier to manage and update the database.

• Additionally, enforcing data constraints, such as unique keys and foreign key relationships, can help prevent redundant data from being inserted into the database.
