‚úÖ 1. **Data Structure**

* **Definition**: A way of organizing and storing data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

* **Purpose**: To perform operations like searching, sorting, inserting, and deleting data in memory.

* **Examples**:

  * Arrays
  * Linked Lists
  * Stacks
  * Queues
  * Trees (e.g., Binary Tree, BST)
  * Graphs
  * Hash Tables

* **Where Used**: Inside programs and algorithms (e.g., C++, Java, Python).

* **Scope**: Usually limited to the runtime of a program or algorithm.

* **Storage**: In RAM (main memory).

 ‚úÖ 2. **Database**

* **Definition**: A structured collection of data stored electronically, designed for persistent storage and retrieval.

* **Purpose**: To store, manage, and retrieve large volumes of data over time.

* **Examples**:

  * MySQL
  * Oracle
  * MongoDB
  * PostgreSQL
  * SQLite

* **Where Used**: In real-world applications like websites, mobile apps, banking systems, etc.

* **Scope**: Long-term data storage and management.

* **Storage**: On disk (secondary storage).
