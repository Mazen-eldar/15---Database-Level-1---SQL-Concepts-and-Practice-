1st Normal Form (1NF)
 1. A primary key: A unique identifier for each record in the 
    table.
 2. Atomic values: Each column should contain only a single 
    value, and each value should be indivisible.

 • Note: Here, atomicity states that a single cell cannot hold multiple 
  values. It must hold only a single-valued attribute.
 • The First normal form disallows the multi-valued attribute, composite 
  attribute, and their combinations.
 3. No repeating groups: Each column should have a distinct 
  name, and there should be no repeating groups of columns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
By applying the First Normal Form, you achieve atomicity, and also every column has unique values.
