What is ERD?
• An Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram) pictorially explains 
the relationship between entities to be stored in a database.

• Fundamentally, the ER Diagram is a structural design of the 
database. 

• It acts as a framework created with specialized symbols for the 
purpose of defining the relationship between the database entities.

• ER diagram is created based on three principal components: 
entities, attributes, and relationships.

What is an ER Model?
• An Entity-Relationship Model represents the structure of the 
database with the help of a diagram. 

• ER Modelling is a systematic process to design a database as it 
would require you to analyze all data requirements before 
implementing your database.
==========================================================================
Why Use ER Diagrams in DBMS?
• ER Diagram helps you conceptualize the database and lets you know 
which fields need to be embedded for a particular entity.

• ER Diagram gives a better understanding of the information to be 
stored in a database.

• It reduces complexity and allows database designers to build 
databases quickly.

• It helps to describe elements using Entity-Relationship models.

• It allows users to get a preview of the logical structure of the 
database.
========================================================================
Conclusion:
• ER Diagram in RDBMS is widely used to describe the conceptual 
design of databases. 

• It helps both users and database developers to preview the 
structure of the database before implementing the database.
