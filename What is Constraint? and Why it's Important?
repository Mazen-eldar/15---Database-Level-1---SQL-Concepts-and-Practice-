Constraints:
• In the context of databases, constraints are rules or conditions that are 
applied to the data to ensure its integrity and consistency. Constraints 
can be applied to individual columns or to entire tables, and they are used 
to enforce various rules and restrictions on the data.

• By using constraints, you can help ensure that your data is accurate, 
consistent, and easy to manage.
====================================================================================
Here are some common types of constraints used in databases:
1.Primary Key Constraint: This constraint ensures that a column or a set of 
columns uniquely identifies each row in a table. This constraint helps to 
enforce data integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in the table.

2.Foreign Key Constraint: This constraint establishes a relationship between two               |============================================================================= |
tables based on a key field. The foreign key constraint ensures that data in one               |                                Interview Question?                           |
table matches data in another table, and it helps to maintain referential                      |What is the difference between Primary Key Constraint and Unique Constraint?  |
integrity in the database.                                                                     |                                                                              |
                                                                                               |Primary Key is Unique but it does not allow NULL  while Unique allows NULL.  |
3.Unique Constraint: This constraint ensures that the data in a column or set of               |==============================================================================|
columns is unique across all rows in the table. This constraint helps to enforce 
data integrity and prevent duplicate values from being inserted into the table.

4. Not Null Constraint: This constraint ensures that a column or set of 
columns cannot contain null (empty) values. This constraint helps to ensure 
that the data is complete and accurate, and it can help prevent errors in 
queries and calculations.

5. Check Constraint: This constraint ensures that the data in a column or set 
of columns meets a specified condition. This constraint helps to enforce data 
integrity and prevent invalid data from being inserted into the table.
