An associative entity is a type of entity in a database 
that is used to model a many-to-many relationship
between two other entities. It is also sometimes called a junction table, a linking table, or a cross-reference table.
======================================================================================================================
By using an associative entity, we can represent
complex relationships between entities in a structured
and efficient way, without having to duplicate data or
create confusing relationships between tables.
It allows us to model many-to-many relationships 
and avoid data redundancy, making it a useful concept in database design.
======================================================================================================================
Representing relationship between an entity and a relationship
which may be required in some scenarios.
In those cases, a relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity.
Aggregation is an abstraction through which we can represent relationships as higher level entity sets.
======================================================================================================================
Aggregation is a specialized form of association between two or more Entities 
in which each Entity has its own Existence.
======================================================================================================================
In aggregation, the relation between two entities is treated as a single entity.
In aggregation, relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity.

-- ðŸ“Œ Summary: Aggregation vs Associative Entity
--
-- ðŸ”¹ Associative Entity:
-- - Used to represent a Many-to-Many (M:N) relationship between two entities.
-- - Implemented as a separate table with foreign keys to both entities.
-- - Often includes attributes specific to the relationship (e.g., EnrollmentDate, Grade).
-- - Example: 'Enrollment' links 'Student' and 'Course'.
--
-- ðŸ”¹ Aggregation:
-- - A conceptual modeling approach where a relationship acts like an entity.
-- - Used when an entire relationship (e.g., Professor teaches Course) participates in another relationship (e.g., supervised by Department).
-- - Not directly represented in SQL but can be modeled using an additional linking table.
-- - Example: 'Supervises' links 'Department' to the relationship 'Teaches' (Professor teaches Course).
