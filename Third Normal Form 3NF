3^rd---->Normal Form (3NF)
 Third Normal Form (3NF) is a higher level of database 
  normalization that builds on the rules of First Normal Form 
  (1NF) and Second Normal Form (2NF). It requires that each non
  key column in a table be dependent only on the primary key, 
  and not on any other non-key columns.


 To satisfy the requirements of 3NF:
 1. Table must first be in 1NF and 2NF, and then have:
 2. No transitive dependencies: Each non-key column in the 
    table must be dependent only on the primary key, and not on 
     any other non-key columns.
