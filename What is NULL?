What is Null
• In a database, "NULL" is a special marker used to indicate that a data 
value does not exist in the database. It represents a missing or unknown 
value in a table column.


• When a field or column in a table has a NULL value, it means that the field 
has no value at all, and it's different from having an empty or zero value. 
NULL is not the same as a blank space or a zero, and it's a distinct value 
in the database.


• NULL can be used in several ways, such as indicating missing data, 
representing optional fields, or as a placeholder for values that are not 
yet known. However, it's essential to use NULL values carefully because 
they can affect the results of queries and calculations in unexpected ways.

absence of a value in a table column. 

• It's used to indicate missing or unknown data and should be used carefully
